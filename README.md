# Raft Distributed Consensus Protocol

This is a repo that demonstrates the usage of the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf). 

This repo leverages `Go` as the primary language and the [Raft Library from Hashicorp](https://github.com/hashicorp/raft)

## Background

In complex distributed environments, it's important for your systems to agree on the current state of the system. This is mandatory because nodes can die and go offline at any point in time. Consensus ensures that all nodes have a replicated state and copy of the system state so it can be resilient against failures.

## How To Run
